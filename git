/*Selecting revisions:
 Both ~ and ^ on their own refer to the parent of the commit (~~ and ^^ both refer to the grandparent commit, etc.) But they differ in meaning when they are used with numbers:

 ~2 means up two levels in the hierarchy, via the first parent if a commit has more than one parent
 ^2 means the second parent where a commit has more than one parent (i.e. because it's a merge)
 These can be combined, so HEAD~2^3 means HEAD's grandparent commit's third parent commit.*/
